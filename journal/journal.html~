<p>I saw somw Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today: "Passong cars, When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity." I definitely won't be passing any cars</p>

<p>MY first day of the trip! I can't believe finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPhone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. just the essentials. As LaoTzu have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."</p>
