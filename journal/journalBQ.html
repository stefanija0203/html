<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and i passed throught some interesting places on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, Bountiful, UT, LAst Chance, CO, Why, AZ an Truth or Consequences, NM.</p>
<h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
<p>I saw somw Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
</p>
<blockquote>Passing cars,
When you can't see,
May get you,
A glimpse,
Of eternity.</blockquote>
<p>I definitely won't be passing any cars</p>

<p>MY first day of the trip! I can't believe finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPhone, iPod, digital camera, and a protein bar. just the essentials. As LaoTzu have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</g></p>
